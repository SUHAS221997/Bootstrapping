Bootstrapping on Diabetes Dataset

This repository demonstrates the use of bootstrapping, a powerful statistical resampling technique, on the Diabetes Dataset. Bootstrapping is applied to explore the dataset, evaluate machine learning models, and assess feature importance, enabling robust analysis and reliable insights.

Dataset Overview

The Diabetes Dataset contains information related to clinical features and test results of patients, often used to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The dataset is widely recognized for classification and regression tasks in machine learning.

Features:

1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin: Serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (genetic influence)
8. Age: Age in years
9. Outcome: Target variable (1 for diabetes, 0 for non-diabetes)
